      <p>This role oversees the Department of Home Affairs’ systems as well as ensuring that their network is secured from external threats. By identifying these threats, the successful applicant must improve the system and reinforce its security to protect sensitive client information.</p>
      <p>I find this position appealing because one of my goals is to create a sense of security for people who put their information online. I have experienced applying for a visa through the Department of Home Affairs. I understand how stressful it is to apply for a visa and wait for an outcome. I can’t imagine how I would feel if I found out that the system that I had trusted with my most personal information was breached.</p>
      <p>According to the job description, they require an individual who can think critically and quickly identify abnormal patterns in the network. They also require someone who has a wide range of experience and the ability to share valuable knowledge with their team. Having a lot of knowledge and experience, this person could be influential in the improvement of the Department’s security system protocols. The Department also requires the applicant to have a tertiary qualification in ICT and industry recognised cyber security qualifications.</p>
      <img src="roledetails.png" alt="Role Details" style="width: 100%">
      <p>At the moment, I do not have the required qualifications and experience to apply for this position. I do, however, have excellent attention to detail which I believe helps in recognising threats and opportunities.</p>
      <p>To be able to qualify for this position in the future, my first step is to complete this course. The second would be to go into an internship or graduate program in cybersecurity or a similar field.</p>
