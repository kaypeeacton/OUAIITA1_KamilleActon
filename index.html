      <h1>My Personal Info</h1>
      <p>Name: Kamille Phoebe Enriquez Acton</P>
      <p>Student number: s3974098</P>
      <p> Email address: s3974098@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
      <p>My name is Kamille Phoebe Enriquez Acton. You might be able to guess from my name that I come from the Philippines. The Philippines was colonised by Spain for 333 years before being colonised by the Americans for 48 years. The Spanish influence on Filipino law, religion, education, language, names, arts, music and cuisine can still be observed today.</p>
      <p>According to the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines(1), the country has more than 111 dialects. I speak three of these dialects: Tagalog, Bisaya, and Ilonggo. Most Filipinos learn Tagalog as this is our national language. However, most of the people around me while I was growing up spoke Bisaya and my relatives spoke Ilonggo so I am fluent in both dialects. We were also expected to learn American English in school. As students, we were expected to reply to our teachers in English as well as write essays, take exams and quizzes in English.</p>
      <p>After graduating high school in 2009, I went to college and studied for a Bachelor of Arts in English. I did this for a year while deciding on what course I want to take in University. Later, I took a Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication and graduated in 2013. I have not done any other formal education until I enrolled in this course.</p>
      <p>While I was at University, I fell in love with videography. We scripted, planned and then created music videos for pop songs and short dramas as well. I found filming itself was the most memorable part as it felt more like hanging out with my friends rather than doing course work. I still shoot short videos here and there about my move to Australia. Everything is interesting, and I find that sharing this experience with friends and family back home allows them to still connect with me even when Iâ€™m abroad.</p>
