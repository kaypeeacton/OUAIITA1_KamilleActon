      <p>I have been interested in technology since I was 14. My grades in computer class in high school and in a basic website development class reflected how I could easily grasp related concepts quickly. However, I have only started to pursue this interest by taking this course.</p>
      <p>In 2014, I worked as a social media specialist for an outsourcing company in the Philippines. I was surrounded by web developers and search engine optimisation experts. I was fascinated with their work, ingenuity, and their ability to find solutions for unexpected bugs.</p>
      <p>I also worked with a marketing company that offered a system to market products through websites and newsletters. The company also offered a customer relationship management system and an eCommerce platform that the team would build from scratch uniquely tailored to each client. I worked in the client support team receiving feedback from clients to personalise their webpage and complaints to log errors. I learned a lot as I watched the team build the platforms; we would sometimes sit together to replicate the errors that our clients were experiencing and brainstorm solutions to their problems. I built great relationships with this team because we maintained clear communication about our clients needs.</p>
      <p>Throughout the years, I have continued to design websites and manage social media for small clients. YouTube has been a great resource, but I have always wanted to expand my knowledge by getting a degree in IT. I hope that by getting this degree, I could move into a permanent career in IT instead of working part time for various small businesses.</p>
      <p>My brother-in-law also switched careers from nursing to IT at RMIT. He introduced me to Code Academy to see if I would be interested in learning more and encouraged me to enrol to the course. Of course, having a full-time job I am only able to do one subject at a time. Thankfully, Open Universities has allowed me to do just that - and helped me maintain a good balance between work, leisure and study.</p>
      <p>My goal is to learn several languages in programming and eventually use this to help build a security system to protect personal data. With the current pace of technological advancement, I would like to provide certainty for people that their personal data will always be secure.</p>
