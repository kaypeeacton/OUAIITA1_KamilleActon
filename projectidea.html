      <b>Overview</b>
      <p>This system enables employees to book clients or projects they will be working on and will show a percentage of how much time they will be putting in for those clients on a daily basis. This system will allow companies to economise the time of their employees, determine whether clients need additional resources to reduce pressure on staff and provide data to renegotiate a higher fee if necessary.</p>

      <b>Motivation</b>
      <p>Employees in the finance industry generally experience extreme time pressures as they handle multiple clients with tight deadlines. This is often stressful for employees as they must ensure that they consistently provide a quality output as well as staying within the engagement budget. I have personally witnessed these pressures while working for an audit firm as an administrative assistant. Big four financial services firms are experiencing a backlash as employees have started to complain about the pressures at work. According to CPA Australia(2), more than 70 percent of accountants are actively looking for or thinking about transitioning into a different career.</p>

      <b>Description</b>
      <p>This system allows its users to book in a specific client that they will be working with and track the amount of time that they spent on working with that client. The employees will create their own account, provide their position and their regular rates per hour. Once this is set, they can then create a client profile. This profile requires the client’s name, contact details, business address, and the engagement fee that the client and the firm has agreed upon.</p>
      <p>Before the employee starts with the project, they can then start to lay out a schedule for when they will be working with the client. The employee will be able to include multiple clients over the course of a day depending on their capacity and the needs of the client.</p>
      <p>Having the engagement fee included in the client profile, the employee’s company will be able to budget and track the time that was spent on each client. The reporting component of the system provides management staff a summary of the combined efforts of employees across different positions. Having this report enables them to step in, ask the right questions and reassess their process in handling such clients.</p>

      <b>Tools and Technologies</b>
      <p>The resource management system will have integrations with accounting programs such as MYOB or Xero to pull into data on what has been billed to a particular project or client. Similar to money management systems like Mint, this software is a budgeting tool. It will have the same functionalities – accounts aggregation, categorisation, budgeting, goal setting or engagement fee budgeting, and analytics. The software would be available for download on both mac and pc; as well as in ios and android devices for the convenience of the user. Companies could easily utilise the program in their team huddles and improve their planning and projections.</p>

      <b>Skills Required</b>
      <p>This software requires UI and UX designers to provide a good user experience. As this is a multi-platform tool, it is essential to have a team of developers that are equipped with programming knowledge across these platforms. According to Relevant(3), developers  who have the ability to use Swift or Objective-C; and Java or Kotlin would be able to develop the program. Back-end engineers will be helpful in maintaining the server side of the software. As this software’s purpose is quite simple, it would be feasible to find a team who has the talent to build this software and team of QAs to ensure that the software serves its purpose well.</p>

      <b>Outcome</b>
      <p>If this project is successful, it will significantly improve project delivery and reporting. According to Quick Scrum, having a resource management software helps in avoiding over-utilisation which solves our original dilemma where employees are feeling overworked and burned out. Projects would more consistently receive adequate attention and therefore be completed to a better standard which would enhance the return on investment by reducing write offs. The software will also allow better transparency between the teams and managers allowing them to address issues where an employee might be overbooked or under booked. The software also allows managers to foresee bookings that might go over the assigned budget and adjust schedules accordingly.</p>
